## üìú About The Project

This project is a full-stack web application developed as a technical test for JEECE, the Junior-Enterprise of ECE Paris. It serves as an online reservation and menu consultation platform for the restaurant "Fouquet," allowing customers to easily book a table and pre-order their meals to reduce waiting times. The application is built entirely on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) as per the project requirements.

## ‚ú® Features

The platform is divided into two main parts: a user-facing side and an administrator dashboard.

### User Features

* **Secure Authentication**: Users can create an account or log in to a personal dashboard. The registration process requires an email, name, and a secure password (minimum 8 characters, with one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character). The authentication system is secured using Tokens.
* **Menu Consultation**: A dedicated page displays the restaurant's menu, including starters, main courses, desserts, and wines, along with their prices. This page is for viewing only.
* **Table Reservation**: A calendar system shows restaurant availability for the next 7 days, with distinct slots for lunch and dinner. Each time slot is limited to 5 reservations.
* **Meal Pre-ordering**: When booking, users must select an entr√©e, a main course, and a dessert for each person in their party. They can also add bottles of wine to their order.
* **Personal Dashboard**: Once logged in, users can access their personal space to:
    * View and edit their profile information (name, first name, profile picture).
    * See a list of all their past and upcoming reservations.
    * Cancel a reservation or modify the pre-ordered menu for an existing booking.

### Administrator Features

* **Admin Dashboard**: Administrators have access to a separate interface to manage the restaurant's operations. Admin accounts are pre-registered directly in the database.
* **Calendar Management**: View a comprehensive calendar showing all reservations, including customer names, party size, and pre-ordered menus.
* **Menu Management (CRUD)**: A dedicated module allows admins to add, modify, or delete dishes and prices on the restaurant's menu.
* **Client Management**: Admins can view a list of all registered clients and have the ability to delete user accounts.

### Bonus Features

* **Redux Integration**: The project was encouraged to use Redux for state management.
* **Table Selection**: Users can choose a specific table from a visual plan during the reservation process.

* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js.
* **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose for object data modeling.
* **Authentication**: Token-based (implied JWT).
* **Styling**: Material-UI was recommended for UI components.
